        Overview
      </h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed leading-relaxed">
        This project provides a method to install custom <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_App" target="_blank">pwas</a> on your VidaaOS-based TV. Before you start, ensure that
        the old <a class="text-blue-500 hover:underline"

          target="_blank">method</a> is no longer supported by your TV. Please note that this project is still under
        development and may not work on all devices. Use it at your own risk.
        Credits go to <a href="https://bananamafia.dev/post/hisensehax/" target="_blank"
          class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">BananaMafia</a> for discovering the exploit. This blog post provided the
        inspiration for creating this project.

      Warning
    </h3>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed leading-relaxed">
      This project is not officially supported by VidaaOS or any of its affiliates. Use at your
      own
      risk.</p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed leading-relaxed">
      This method theoretically allows to install apps, code, scripts, or files on your TV. Only use trusted hosts to
      avoid potential risks (the safest
      option is to self-host!).
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed leading-relaxed mt-2">
      The Hisense API provides several powerful functions, including:
      <br>
      <code>-> Hisense_installApp</code> <br>
      <code>-> Hisense_GetNetworkInfo</code> <br>
      <code>-> Hisense_GetIPAddress</code> <br>
      <code>-> Hisense_FileRead</code> <br>
      <code>-> Hisense_FileWrite</code> <br>
      and many more.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed leading-relaxed mt-2">
      Projects like this one (or similar ones?) can theoretically cause harm if these functions are
      misused, especially through malicious apps or scripts. These risks can be amplified if
      JavaScript global functions are exploited. Always be aware of the potential dangers and act
      responsibly when using this method. For additional information read the following blog <a
        href="https://bananamafia.dev/post/hisensehax/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">post</a>

        Details
      </h3>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-relaxed leading-relaxed">
        The global functions can only be executed if the domain name is "vidaahub.com". For this reason, it is <span class="underline decoration-dotted">important</span> to "fake" the domain name. This is achieved using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">DNS</a> server, which resolves domain names to IP addresses.
        <br><br>
        If you choose the self-hosted solution, make sure to configure the network settings of your VidaaOS device to use your self-hosted DNS server. This will ensure that the project is recognized as "vidaahub.com".
        <br><br>
        Alternatively, if you opt for an already-hosted version of this project, you will need to set the provided DNS server in your network settings. This will make the hosted project accessible as "vidaahub.com".
